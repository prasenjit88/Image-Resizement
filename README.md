# Image Processing Pipeline  
An automated image resizing system for efficient processing and storage.  

## 📌 Developer  
**Prasenjit Jana**  

## 📖 About  
This project is an automated image processing pipeline that dynamically resizes images and stores them in **Amazon S3**. The system leverages **AWS Lambda** for scalable, serverless processing and integrates with **CloudWatch** for real-time monitoring.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
* **Amazon S3** – Storage for resized images.  
* **AWS Lambda** – Serverless function for dynamic image processing.  
* **IAM Role** – Secure access management.  
* **CloudWatch** – Log monitoring and performance tracking.  
* **API Gateway** – Seamless integration with other AWS services.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Automated Image Resizing** – Efficient and scalable image processing.  
✅ **AWS Lambda Integration** – Processes large batches of images dynamically.  
✅ **CloudWatch Monitoring** – Tracks performance and detects issues in real-time.  
✅ **Modular Design** – Easily integrates with other AWS services.  

## 🏗️ Storage & Processing  
🔹 Images are automatically resized and stored in **Amazon S3**.  
🔹 Logs are monitored in **CloudWatch** for debugging and performance tracking.  

This system ensures **scalability, real-time monitoring, and seamless AWS integration** for efficient image processing.
